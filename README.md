## API and Data Sample
*WIP*
Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
Creating the database content and obtaining the necessary information. Developing the wireframes and understanding CSS.

### Weaknesses:
Narrowing down tasks.

### Opportunities:

Expand my React knowledge and use the class curriculum to build something from scratch. 

### Threats:
Overcomplicating, trying to accomplish too many tasks.
